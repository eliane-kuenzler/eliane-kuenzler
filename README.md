## Hi there 👋

I'm Eliane, currently teaching Introduction to Python at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences. I completed my Master's in Medical Technology at ETH Zürich and enjoy planning, experimenting, and integrating innovative solutions to enhance performance and data analysis in sports.

Currently, I’m coding mostly in Python, but I love exploring new languages.

### 🔥 Recent Projects
- 🎯 Master's Thesis: Automated scoring system for competitive climbing 🧗‍♀️
- 🏃‍♀️ Movement Analysis Pipeline: Python-based tool for biomechanical data processing
- 📊 Sports Performance Dashboard: Interactive visualization for athlete metrics

### 💻 Tech & Languages
- Python – My main language for now, but always excited to learn more!
- C++ – A love-hate relationship 😆
- MATLAB – The go-to for movement analysis 🏃‍♀️
- R – My deep dive into statistics 📊

### 🚀 What’s Next?
I’m excited to see where my programming journey takes me — maybe diving deeper into software engineering or exploring new tech fields!
