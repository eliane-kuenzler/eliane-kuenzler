## Hi there 👋

I'm Eliane, a Master’s student @ ETH passionate about coding in sports technology. I enjoy planning, experimenting, and integrating innovative solutions to enhance performance and data analysis in sports.

Currently, I’m coding mostly in Python, but I love exploring new languages and aim to grow in software engineering.

### 🔥 What I'm Working On
- 🎯 Master’s Thesis: Automating the scoring system in climbing 🧗‍♀️

### 💻 Tech & Languages
- Python – My main language for now, but always excited to learn more!
- C++ – A love-hate relationship 😆
- MATLAB – The go-to for movement analysis 🏃‍♀️
- R – My deep dive into statistics 📊

### 🚀 What’s Next?
After my Master’s thesis, I’m excited to see where my programming journey takes me — maybe diving deeper into software engineering or exploring new tech fields!
